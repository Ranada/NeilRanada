I coded this UX portfolio back in 2017 after completing my UX online bootcamp using HTML, CSS, Material Design Lite library, and jQuery. 

I'm in the process of **professional re-branding and will update it to reflect my current UX  and software engineering skills.** 

Much of my best UX work is under NDA from my three years at UEGroup, a Silicon Valley-based UX firm. I'm keeping my early-career UX projects since it still captures my thought process. **I will start including my software development projects.**

In the meantime, you can check out my portfolio at:
