Hi! I'm Neil.

I'm a designer with over 10 years of professional experience in aviation, aerospace, and defense. I practice design thinking backed by quantitative and qualitative research. I solve challenging problems by making mobile apps, websites, and other digital products easier to use so that people can focus on what matters most to them.

This repo is for my UX research and design portfolio.

I'm currently available for remote work. Learn more at:
