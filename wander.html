                          <h1 class="section-title nav-menu-item">Summary</h1>
                          <hr>
                          <p>Do you love to travel? A well-planned walking path is one of the best ways see things, especially if you’re tight on time. I designed an Android travel app called Wander to make it easier to plan walking paths.</p>

                          <h2>Problem</h2>
                          <p>Most travel apps rely on computer-generated walking paths. Sometimes these paths don’t make sense, are unsafe, or not exactly what you want to do. Most frustratingly, travel apps give you little control to make changes.</p>

                          <h2>Solution</h2>
                          <p>Dial back technology and use a time-tested way of getting directions: drawing on a map. Digital maps with routes drawn by people, not computers.</p>
                          <p>Wander is an Android platform that allows people to create, select, edit, vote, and share walking paths. The goal is to give users more control.</p>

                          <!-- Discovery -->
                          <h2>Discovery</h2>
                          <p>I once went on a solo adventure to Kyoto, Japan. The old capital is full of incredible history and sights. I underestimated its vastness and only had two and a half days to see it.</p>

                          <div class="background-photo-scalable" style="background-image:url(images/wander/fushima-inari-shrine.jpg);"></div>

                          <p>It turns out Kyoto is a walkable city. A Japanese travel guide gave me paper maps breaking down the city into sections. Each map section showed suggested walking routes. But it was raining, and it became a pain to use my rain-soaked maps without tearing them apart.</p>

                          <p>I tried using Kyoto’s travel website instead. It has digital maps with similar walking routes. But it wasn’t mobile-friendly, and I couldn’t expand the maps to fill the full size of my phone’s screen.</p>

                          <div class="background-photo-tall" style="background-image:url(images/wander/kyoto-digital-map@2x.png);"></div>
                          <h6 class="text-align-center">Kyoto digital walking map. Source: http://www.japan-guide.com</h6>

                          <p class="bottom-spacer">Why couldn’t I have a mobile-friendly map with walking paths? Did other people have the same problem?</p>

                          <!-- Research -->
                          <h1 class="section-title nav-menu-item">Research</h1>
                          <hr>

                          <p>First, I needed to figure out if there was an opportunity to solve a problem. I can’t design solutions for a problem that doesn’t exist.</p>

                          <p>I started my research by making an assumption: people need a travel app that makes it easier for them to plan walking paths. To validate this, I needed to answer three questions:</p>

                          <ol>
                            <li>Is there a need for a tool to make it easier to plan walking paths?</li>
                            <li>If so, who needs it?</li>
                            <li>What features do they need?</li>
                          </ol>

                          <p>I conducted two surveys and two rounds of interviews to find answers. I asked questions focused on past experiences and behaviors. I also wanted to know any frustrations people had with travel planning tools.</p>

                          <h2>First Survey</h2>

                          <p>I posted a <a href="https://neilranada.typeform.com/report/jD0CrJ/bcnj" target="_blank">survey online</a> to various social media platforms and public forums. I asked general questions about people's last sightseeing experience. I didn't mention anything about walking paths at this point. I wanted to see what problems or successes people would share that I may not have considered.</p>

                          <p>Here are my key findings from the 19 responses:</p>

                          <ul>
                              <li>100% said they used smartphones to browse websites to plan sightseeing.</li> 
                              <li>A majority used Google Search (89%) and TripAdvisor (84%) for research.</li>
                              <li>Fewer people used social media in their travel research: Facebook (21%) and Instagram (21%).</li>
                              <li>People used Facebook (79%) and Instagram (47%) to post travel photos.</li> 
                              <li>When asked to select one experience that needed improvement: "planning route and schedule" was the top issue.</li>
                          </ul>

                          <h2>Mobile-first and the need for more research</h2>

                          <p>Based on the results, it wasn't clear if there was a need for a tool to make walking paths easier to plan. However, if there was a need, it was clear that I needed to use a "mobile first" design approach. It was also clear that I needed to learn how people used Google Search and TripAdvisor for travel research.</p>

                          <p>Social media played less of a role in travel research than I expected. But, I still think there may be an opportunity to discover a greater connection between maps and social media, especially since Instagram is full of photo feeds for travel inspiration. I decided it was beyond the scope of this project but may be worth researching another time.</p>

                          <h2>Interviews</h2>

                          <p>During this project, I took a two-week trip to the Philippines to attend a wedding on Boracay Island. Many of my friends also attended. Different groups had separate plans for sightseeing before and after the wedding. It was the perfect opportunity to make observations and conduct interviews.</p>

                          <p>Here are key findings from interviewing 12 people:</p>

                          <ul>
                              <li>People used Google Search or TripAdvisor to find and compare lists of top things to see and do.</li>
                              <li>Planning tended to stop at the city level in their search. Once in Manila, people weren't sure of what places they wanted to see. If they did have an idea, they weren't sure of the best order to see everything in a short period.</li>
                              <li>Everyone's definition of sightseeing varied. Some people wanted to walk around historical places like the Intramuros, an old walled city. Others wanted to see street markets or the giant Mall of Asia.</li>
                              <li>People on this trip relied on Google Maps to walk from point to point. They didn't have a walking path in mind.</li> 
                          </ul>

                          <h2>Point-to-Point Navigators vs. Planners</h2>

                          <p>There’s a spectrum of how people navigate. On one end, there are what I call “point-to-point” navigators and on the other end “planners.” People on this trip leaned towards being “point-to-point” navigators. Navigating to one place at a time using Google Maps. They didn’t necessarily need a walking path with all their stops planned out.</p>

                          <p>There wasn’t evidence at this point to design a walking path tool. To move forward, I needed to find and interview “planners.” People who like having itineraries.</p>

                          <h2>Second Survey</h2>

                          <p>Before conducting another set of interviews, I posted another <a href="https://neilranada.typeform.com/report/BbEEgk/CCph" target="_blank">survey</a>. This time, I asked specific questions about what tools people used to plan walking paths. I provided both digital and paper options. I also needed to know what they liked most about these tools, and what they liked least.</p>

                          <p>Here are key findings from the 32 responses:</p>

                          <ul>
                              <li>Travel apps like Google Trips (6%), Cool Cousin (3%), and FieldTrip (1%) are not popular tools for planning walking paths.</li>
                          </ul>

                          <p>Here is a selection of comments:</p>

                          <ul class="quotes">
                              <li>“I don't think there is an obvious way to customize my route. I think I can create a route but it seems complicated.”</li>
                              <li>“It can take me to shady places...”</li> 
                              <li>“Lack of suggested routes/plans to cover various sight-seeing points.”</li>
                              <li>“When I'm abroad and don't have mobile internet access, or I'm in a heavily pedestrian urban area (like Marrakech) where the maps may not be detailed enough, then Google Maps fails me. That's when I turn to paper maps of some sort, or maybe an offline map intended for travelers if I don't need to worry about having my phone out.”</li> 
                          </ul>

                          <h2>Realizing an opportunity to solve a problem</h2>

                          <p>After the second round of surveys, I realized that some apps fall short in planning walking paths. There were two main pain points:</p>

                          <ol>
                              <li>Feeling unsafe</li> 
                              <li>Inability to easily create and edit a path</li> 
                          </ol>

                          <p>At this point, I realized an opportunity to design a tool for people who are most likely to use route suggestions to cover various sight-seeing points. </p>

                          <h2 class="nav-sub-menu-item">User Personas</h2>

                          <p>I identified three people to interview who plan their travels in advance. These are people who I assessed would benefit most from a tool for planning walking paths.</p>

                          <img src="images/wander/traveling-mom@2x.png" alt="traveling mom" class="bottom-spacer">
                          <img src="images/wander/traveling-couple@2x.png" alt="traveling couple" class="bottom-spacer">
                          <img src="images/wander/traveling-solo@2x.png" alt="traveling solo">

                          <p class="bottom-spacer tex"><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ptdj2y2y3mh161b/Wander-User-Personas.pdf?dl=0">Open file for User Personas<i class="material-icons">open_in_new</i></a></p>

                          <h2>Top 3 goals of the User Personas</h2>

                          <ol>
                              <li>Discover itineraries that match their interests and schedule</li>
                              <li>Easily edit their path and points of interest</li> 
                              <li>Follow a route but also have the freedom to explore</li>
                          </ol>

                          <p>I based my decisions around these three goals throughout my design process. Next, I needed to learn from the competition.</p>

                          <h2 class="nav-sub-menu-item">Competitive Analysis</h2>

                          <p>I analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of travel app competitors. I identified six travel apps: TripAdvisor, Google Trips, Walc, FieldTrip, Cool Cousin, and Triposo.</p>

                          <p class="bottom-spacer">I conducted SWOT analysis, creating matrixes such as the one below, to assess the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of each app.</p>

                          <img src="images/wander/swot-analysis.png" alt="swot analysis">

                          <p class="bottom-spacer"><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ptdj2y2y3mh161b/Wander-User-Personas.pdf?dl=0">View analysis matrixes for other apps<i class="material-icons">open_in_new</i></a></p>

                          <p>I also downloaded Triposo. Out of the list of travel apps I analyzed, Triposo had the most advanced tool for planning a walking route to multiple sightseeing points.</p>

                          <div class="background-photo-tall" style="background-image:url(images/wander/triposo-city-walks@2x.png);"></div>
                          <h6 class="text-align-center">Screenshot from Triposo iPhone app.</h6>

                          <h2>Top three strengths to include in the design:</h2>

                          <ol>
                              <li>Crowd-sourcing to provide self-sustaining content production</li>
                              <li>Voting system to let people decide what is most helpful</li>
                              <li>Integration with Google Maps because its database is extensive and trustworthy</li>
                          </ol>

                          <h2>Top three weaknesses to avoid in the design:</h2>

                          <ol>
                              <li>Overwhelming number of features and information</li>
                              <li>Computer generated routes that are unsafe or do not make sense</li>
                              <li>Making it difficult for people to edit a path and change points of interest</li>
                          </ol>

                          <h2>Field research at Balboa Park, San Diego</h2>

                          <p>I also took advantage of the fact that I live in San Diego, a major tourist destination. I spent several mornings and afternoons at Balboa Park. I hung out next to maps posted throughout the park. I casually interviewed people to find out what they were searching. I also wanted to see what they thought was helpful, and what was frustrating.</p>

                          <h2>Time tested way of finding directions</h2>

                          <p>People still rely on friends, or even strangers, to find directions. This behavior reinforced the crowd-sourcing and social approach in the design.</p>

                          <p>Sometimes the best way to find where you’re going is to ask someone who can draw directions for you on a paper map. With this in mind, I needed to design a digital version of this time-tested method of getting directions.</p>

                          <p>It also occurred to me that not everyone walks on paths. Sometimes people move around on wheels: wheelchairs, scooters, bikes, skates, etc. It reminded me to push for inclusive design.</p>

                          <h2 class="nav-sub-menu-item">Paper Wireframes</h2>

                          <p>I spent the majority of my time creating wireframes to focus on the functionality of the travel app. I sketched using pen and paper which let me put my design ideas down quickly. For inspiration, I looked to patterns found in popular apps such as TripAdvisor and Airbnb.</p>

                          <p>I went through each user story and wrote the task in the top left corner of each page to focus on the particular problem I needed to solve.</p>

                          <p>Here are a couple of early wireframe sketches attempting to solve for the following user story:<p> 
                          <p class="highlight">"As a user...I want to search recommended paths...so that I can find the best way to see popular sights."</p>

                          <img src="images/wander/wireframe-search-cards@2x.png">
                          <h6>Flowing from a collection of cards to a map.</h6>

                          <img src="images/wander/wireframe-search-list@2x.png">
                          <h6>Flowing from list view to a page with information and photos for a point of interest.</h6>

                          <p>User testing later revealed that I needed to use a blend of the two ideas above. A list for easier skimming instead of cards. And a map view instead of an info page with photos because that’s what testers expected after selecting a path.</p>

                          <p>The most challenging problem I focused on was how people could seamlessly make changes to customize their walking path. Here is a progression of wireframe sketches designing for the user story:</p>

                          <p class="highlight">“As a user…I want to change the path on my map…so that I can modify my path.”</p>

                          <img src="images/wander/wireframe-change-path-early@2x.png">

                          <h6>Later version.</h6>

                          <p>Testing revealed that most people could not associate the unlabeled Floating Action Button with making changes to a path. I discuss this issue later under the "Testing" section.</p>

                          <h2 class="nav-sub-menu-item">Visual Design</h2>

                          <p>I moved on to visual design to see if visual hierarchy, color contrast, and the realism of mockups of the app would help users select and edit a path. I started by sketching and brainstorming to come up with a brand name.</p>

                          <div class="background-photo-scalable bottom-spacer" style="background-image:url(images/wander/brain-storm@2x.png);"></div>

                          <h2>Logo</h2>

                          <p>Next, I brainstormed logo ideas for Wander. I analyzed logos from well-known companies like Facebook, Instagram, and Airbnb for inspiration. The logos tended to be flat, simple, and scalable to small sizes.</p>

                          <div class="background-photo-scalable bottom-spacer" style="background-image:url(images/wander/logo-sketches@2x.png);"></div>

                          <h2>Color</h2>

                          <p>I used nostalgic travel posters for color inspiration and created a mood board using Pinterest. Then I looked to Dribbble's color picker to find a color palette to match the theme I wanted to achieve. I also used Adobe's Color Wheel to find a complimentary color.</p>

                          <h2>Typography</h2>

                          <p class="bottom-spacer">I chose Courgette for the brand name and titles throughout the app. The typeface designer, Karolina Lach, describes Courgette as a medium-contrast, brushy, italic-script typeface to give a loose, wispy feel to the Wander brand name.</p>

                          <h2>Style Guide</h2>

                          <p>Lastly, I used Google's Material Design guidelines for typography details to complete the style guide.</p>

                          <img src="images/wander/style-guide-wander@2x.png" alt="style guide">

                          <h2 class="nav-sub-menu-item">Mockups</h2>

                          <p>I created 71 pages of high-fidelity mockups using Adobe XD and Google’s Material Design guidelines.</p>

                          <p>I designed Wander to be highly interactive especially in the path editing mode. I needed users to be able to distinguish what was clickable and to create icons that looked like physical buttons. Material Design’s 3D approach was better suited for those goals than a flat design approach.</p>

                          <p>Flow for drawing a new path and having the option to undo or save changes:</p>

                          <div class="background-photo-scalable bottom-spacer" style="background-image:url(images/wander/mockup-map-flow@2x.png);"></div>

                          <!-- Testing -->
                          <h1 class="section-title nav-menu-item">Testing</h1>
                          <hr>

                          <p>I tested early and often during every phase of the design process: wireframes, mockups, and prototype. I took every opportunity to test in person or remotely online to refine my design solutions.</p>

                          <p>The most challenging problem I tried to resolve was the task: "As a registered user, I want to change the path on my map."</p>

                          <p>Initially, I used Material Design’s Floating Action Button (FAB) to allow people to edit their path. However, test results showed that the FAB was not clear in its function.</p>

                          <h2 class="nav-sub-menu-item">Low-Fidelity Tests</h2>
                          
                          <p>I tested the Floating Action Button wireframe sketches using click tests and navigation tests on UsabilityHub. Here is a test result showing a low success rate of people clicking on the Floating Action Button for the corresponding user story:</p>

                          <p class="highlight">“As a user…I want to change the path on my map…so that I can modify my path.”</p>

                          <div class="background-photo-tall" style="background-image:url(images/wander/edit-path-wireframe-2.jpg);"></div>

                          <p>I then tested mockups to see if color and context would people identify the Floating Action Buttons purpose. The results showed little improvement. Again attempting to solve for:</p>

                          <p class="highlight">“As a user…I want to change the path on my map…so that I can modify my path.”</p>

                          <div class="background-photo-tall" style="background-image:url(images/wander/edit-path-mockup-1.png);"></div>

                          <p>I then redesigned the Floating Action Button and labeled it “Edit Path,” which yielded undoubtedly better results.</p>

                          <div class="background-photo-tall" style="background-image:url(images/wander/edit-path-mockup-2.png);"></div>
                          <h6 class="text-align-center">Button re-design showing high concentration of successful clicks to change path.</h6>

                          <p>The test results proved the need to break away from Material Design’s guidelines. The pencil icon is widely understood to mean edit. But it wasn’t clear what the Floating Action Button could change since Material Design doesn’t use labels.</p>

                          <h2 class="usability-testing nav-sub-menu-item">Usability Testing</h2> 

                          <p>I conducted four usability tests. Two in-person and two remotely. Using Lookback.io, Quicktime, or a digital camera, I recorded people’s body language, thoughts, reactions, and where they clicked on the prototype screens. Each session was approximately 10 minutes long.</p>

                          <p>I gave testers the following tasks:</p>

                          <ol>
                              <li>Find a path using your current GPS location on your phone.</li>

                              <li>Filter the list for half-day plans made for photographers.</li>

                              <li>Select a path that will show the best photo spots at Balboa Park.</li>

                              <li>Sign-up using your email.</li>

                              <li>Create your profile. Upload a profile photo. Then add your profile 
                              name and story.</li>

                              <li>“Like” the current path to save it for later.</li>

                              <li>You decide to make some changes to the path. You’re no longer 
                              interested in the Sculpture Garden. Remove its location marker.</li>

                              <li>You think the Spreckels Organ Pavilion on the left side of the map 
                              is more interesting than the Sculpture Garden. Add its gray location 
                              marker.</li> 

                              <li>Erase the top portion of the path and re-draw it going to the new 
                              location marker you just added.</li>

                              <li>You think the path you created is awesome. Share it with family and

                          <h2>Three key changes based on the usability test results:</h2>
                          <ol>
                            <li>Added name labels to the location markers.</li>
                            <li>Allowed people to remove location markers from the edit path view.</li>
                            <li>Added save buttons to allow people to confirm their edits, rather than use an auto-save feature.</li>
                          </ol>

                          <!-- Prototype -->
                          <h1 class="section-title nav-menu-item">Prototype</h1>
                          <hr>
                          <p><a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/41545c7a-8638-473b-92bd-716e5b0270c8/" target="_blank">Open Prototype and try out the usability tasks in the section above.<i class="material-icons">open_in_new</i></a></p> 
                          <p>I used Adobe XD for rapid prototyping. Adobe XD was especially useful for creating flows for the many combinations of actions a person can take in the map view.</p>

                          <div class="background-photo-scalable bottom-spacer" style="background-image:url(images/wander/prototype-map-flow@2x.png);"></div>

                          <h2>Other lessons learned: touch target size matters</h2> 

                          <p>Another lesson learned during the early stages of the prototype was to remember that touch target size matters for mobile devices. One person I randomly tested struggled to see anything happen when they tried to click on icons. In this case, the 24 x 24 dp icons were too small to register a response. </p>

                          <p class="bottom-spacer">Material Design says touch targets should be at least 48 x 48 dp to ensure a physical size of about 9mm regardless of screen size. There should also be at least 8 dp separation between them. I made changes to include the minimum suggested touch zone size and spacing. I immediately saw testers move more fluidly through the app.</p>

                          <!-- Conclusion -->
                          <h1 class="section-title nav-menu-item">Conclusion</h1>
                          <hr>

                          <p>I created a travel app that gives people more control in planning walking paths.</p>  

                          <p>My biggest doubt was whether people would find Wander valuable. Testing showed that my app could benefit people in planning their travels.</p>

                          <p>What surprised me most was the amount of research, design, and testing required to solve for a relatively small list of tasks. There are so many other design features to add to make the app more complete and fully functioning.</p>

                          <p>If given more time, I would create a coded prototype to test how a person would navigate at Balboa Park. A proven navigation feature would add greater value to the app.</p>

                          <p>I would also collaborate with experts in design, engineering, and business. They could offer valuable perspectives from their respective fields that I may not have considered. Their fresh ideas and teamwork would result in better solutions.</p> 

                          <p class="bottom-spacer">This project was challenging and helped me grow as a designer, more than any other project up to this point. I learned the value of discovering problems early and making smaller more manageable changes. I also learned the importance of being able to validate and defend my design decisions. I'll take these lessons learned and continue to improve my design process for the future. </p>
